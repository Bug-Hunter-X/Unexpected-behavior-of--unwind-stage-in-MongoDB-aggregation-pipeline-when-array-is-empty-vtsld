# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline $unwind Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `$unwind` stage in MongoDB aggregation pipelines.  The error occurs when the array being unwound is sometimes empty.

## The Problem

The provided `bug.js` script uses an aggregation pipeline to join two collections (`collectionA` and `collectionB`). The `$unwind` stage is used to deconstruct the `results` array. However, if the `results` array is empty for a particular document in `collectionA`, the `$unwind` stage throws an error or produces unexpected results.  This is because `$unwind` expects an array to unwind.  If you are not careful to handle empty arrays, it can lead to unexpected data or pipeline failures.

## The Solution

The solution, shown in `bugSolution.js`, utilizes the `$lookup` and `$unwind` stages more safely.  It first checks the length of the array and only uses the `$unwind` operator when the length is greater than 0, preventing any errors or unexpected behaviors.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Create two collections, `collectionA` and `collectionB`, in your MongoDB database.
2.  Populate `collectionA` and `collectionB` with documents with the appropriate structure.  Ensure that some documents in `collectionA` have empty arrays in the `results` field.
3.  Run `bug.js`. Observe the error or unexpected behavior.
4.  Run `bugSolution.js`. Note that it handles the empty array case gracefully.

## Further Notes

This issue highlights the importance of data validation and careful consideration when using the `$unwind` operator in MongoDB aggregation pipelines. Always anticipate and handle situations where the target array might be empty.
